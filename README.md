# PARINDE
Parinde – Aerial Intelligence for Public Safety
Parinde is a purpose-built drone designed to empower frontline public service workers—such as police officers, emergency medical responders, and firefighters—with real-time aerial intelligence. Developed with the goal of improving accessibility, response time, and situational awareness, Parinde directly contributes to enhancing public safety, especially in densely populated and infrastructure-challenged areas.

Mission & Vision
In many urban and semi-urban regions of our country, narrow roads and heavy congestion hinder the effective movement of emergency services. Parinde addresses this by providing a compact, highly mobile aerial platform capable of navigating these environments and delivering critical real-time data.
Its core functionality is focused on image processing and real-time analytics—detecting traffic congestion, identifying its root cause, and triggering alerts to the relevant departments. Whether it’s an accident, a fire, or a medical emergency, Parinde ensures that the Police, Fire Department, and Health Services are informed and coordinated swiftly to safeguard the lives of citizens.
